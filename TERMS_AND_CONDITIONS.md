# Terms and Conditions

**Last Updated: 2023-12-23**

Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the service operated by the Host Tenant ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service.

## 1. Subscription Plans & Payments

We offer several subscription plans for our tenant users. By subscribing to a plan, you agree to pay the fees associated with that plan.

### Subscription Packages:

*   **Basic Plan:**
    *   R29 per month
    *   R290 per year
*   **Medium Plan:**
    *   R59 per month
    *   R590 per year
*   **Premium Plan:**
    *   R99 per month
    *   R990 per year

All payments are due in advance on a monthly or yearly basis, as selected at the time of subscription.

## 2. Service Availability & Non-Payment

The service provided to a tenant is contingent upon timely payment of the subscription fees.

*   **Active Service:** A tenant's site and services will remain active as long as their subscription is paid up to date.
*   **Suspension:** In the event of non-payment, the tenant's site and access to services will be automatically disabled and suspended.
*   **Reactivation:** Service will be restored once all outstanding subscription fees have been paid in full.

## 3. Refund Policy

We offer a straightforward refund policy.

*   **Monthly Subscriptions:** You may request a refund within 7 days of the initial purchase.
*   **Yearly Subscriptions:** You may request a refund within 30 days of the initial purchase. The refund will be pro-rated based on the number of unused months remaining in the subscription term.
*   Refunds will be processed through the original payment method. To request a refund, please contact our support team.

## 4. Host Tenant Charges

The fees charged by the Host Tenant are solely for the subscription to the platform and access to the features corresponding to the selected plan. These charges cover the use of our software, hosting of the tenant site, and platform maintenance.

We do **not** charge any commission or fees on the transactions that you process through your own payment gateways.

## 5. Tenant Responsibilities & Payment Gateways

Our application provides functionality that allows tenants to accept payments from their own customers. To use this functionality, tenants must integrate with a third-party payment gateway.

*   **Tenant Responsibility:** It is the sole responsibility of each tenant to register, create, and maintain their own account with a supported payment gateway provider (e.g., Ozow, PayFast, etc.).
*   **Configuration:** Tenants must use their own private credentials and configurations provided by their payment gateway to enable payment processing on their site. The application provides the interface to input these configurations, but we do not manage them.
*   **Third-Party Relationship:** Your relationship with your payment gateway provider is governed by their own terms and conditions. The Host Tenant is not a party to that agreement and is not responsible for any issues, disputes, or fees that may arise from your use of their service.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. In no event shall the Host Tenant, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your use of the service or any third-party services integrated with it.

## 7. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of South Africa, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

## 8. Changes

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect.

By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.
